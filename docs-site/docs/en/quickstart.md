# 5-minute quick setup

> 💡 **TL;DR**: `npm i -g botmux` → `botmux setup` (**a single Lark QR scan** creates the app + configures all permissions + publishes) → `botmux start` → `botmux autostart enable` → add the bot to a group and start chatting.

**Before you start**: confirm the [Prerequisites](/en/prerequisites) (Node ≥ 22, target CLI installed and logged in) — a missing prerequisite here is the most common cause of "installed but won't connect."

## Step 1 · Install

```bash
npm install -g botmux
```

Requires **Node.js ≥ 22**, with at least one AI coding CLI already installed and signed in locally (`claude` / `codex` / `cursor-agent` / `gemini` / `opencode` / `coco` / `agy`, etc.). **The default session backend is tmux (≥3.x), so install it** — when it's unavailable botmux hard-gates with a card instead of silently downgrading to pty; only pick an explicit backend (`BACKEND_TYPE=pty` or per-bot `backendType`: `pty`/`herdr`/`zellij`) if you truly need a tmux-free environment (riff is a cloud agent and doesn't occupy a local backend).

## Step 2 · Configure (`botmux setup`)

```bash
botmux setup
```

An interactive wizard; just follow the prompts:

1. **New config**: type `1` and press Enter. (If you already have a config, type `2` to add a bot.)
2. **Create a bot**:
   - Type `1` → **Create by QR code** (recommended): scan with Lark, and a PersonalAgent app is created automatically with the AppID/AppSecret saved to disk; event subscriptions and bot capabilities are pre-configured by default.
   - Type `2` → **Create manually**: go to the [Lark Open Platform](https://open.larkoffice.com/app) to create a custom enterprise app, then paste the AppID/AppSecret.
3. **Pick a CLI**: choose the CLI to onboard this time (e.g. choose `1` for Claude Code).
4. **Default working directory**: usually fill in the **parent directory** of your git projects (e.g. `~/projects`); it searches up to 3 levels down. Try not to use `~` (it would have to traverse too many folders).

> ✅ **Both Feishu (feishu.cn) and Lark (international, larksuite.com) are supported**: when creating the app by QR code, the tenant type is detected automatically; when pasting manually, you can choose it. You can mix both on the same machine.

> 🔧 **Creating by QR code auto-configures all permissions and publishes a version** — no manual steps needed. Only if you add `botmux setup --no-open-platform-auto` (skip auto-config) or create the app manually do you need to import the permission JSON yourself in the Open Platform (setup writes the full set to `~/.botmux/lark-scopes.json` and prints a one-click copy command) and create/publish a version; choosing availability "Visible to me only" gets auto-approved.

## Step 3 · Start

```bash
botmux start            # Start the daemon
botmux autostart enable # Start on boot (recommended; survives machine restarts, no sudo needed)
```

## Step 4 · Create a group and start chatting

1. Create a **topic group** in Lark (regular groups are also supported).
2. Group settings → Group bots → add the bot you just created.
3. Send a message directly in the group, and the bot responds automatically — it pops up a repository selection card, and once you pick a project the CLI launches in that directory.

You can also **DM the bot** to start chatting directly, or use `botmux dashboard` and switch to the Group Tab to create a group with one click.

## Not receiving messages? Self-check

Most "no messages" cases are **local config or network issues**, not a botmux bug. botmux already wires up an AI agent — so **run a one-shot headless self-check with your CLI** and let it read the logs, check the config, and give you a verdict.

First save the diagnostic task into a variable (single line, so you don't have to paste it repeatedly):

```bash
DIAG='botmux is not receiving messages in the Lark group. Diagnose read-only (do NOT change anything), run these in order and give the most likely cause + fix: botmux status (is the daemon running); botmux logs --lines 150 (look for WebSocket connection failures, token/auth errors, permission errors 401/403/411/400, CLI spawn failures); cat ~/.botmux/bots.json (check AppID/Secret/CLI config); judge whether the long-lived WebSocket is blocked by a corporate network/proxy/firewall. Conclude at the end.'
```

Pick one line for the CLI you have installed (all non-interactive; they print the verdict and exit):

```bash
claude -p "$DIAG" --allowedTools "Bash"   # Claude Code
codex exec "$DIAG"                         # Codex
gemini -p "$DIAG" --yolo                   # Gemini
coco  -p "$DIAG" --yolo                    # Trae / CoCo (aliases trae-agent / ta)
cursor-agent -p "$DIAG"                    # Cursor
```

> The trailing flags (`--allowedTools` / `--yolo`, etc.) just let the agent actually run commands and read logs — it's a read-only check. `botmux logs` can pinpoint almost any problem; it's the gold standard.

Still stuck? Check manually (usually local-side):

- **Daemon not running / config changed without restart** → `botmux status`, then `botmux restart`.
- **Incomplete bot permissions / reusing a bot created from an old app** (most common) → see [Common Pitfalls](/en/pitfalls); recreate via the latest `botmux setup` QR flow.
- **Event subscriptions / bot capability** (only needed for manually-created apps): in the Open Platform, subscribe to `im.message.receive_v1` + `card.action.trigger` (long-lived WebSocket), and enable App features → Bot.
- **Network**: the long-lived WebSocket can't get out (corporate network / proxy / firewall) → the agent will see the connection errors in the logs.

After confirming, run `botmux restart`. See [FAQ / Troubleshooting](/en/faq) for more.
