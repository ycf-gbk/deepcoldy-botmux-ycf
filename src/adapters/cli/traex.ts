/**
 * TRAE CLI (a.k.a. traex / traecli) adapter.
 *
 * TRAE is a Codex-family CLI — it shares the same bracketed-paste input
 * protocol, `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` / `--no-alt-screen`
 * flags, `resume <uuid>` subcommand, and `›` prompt marker.
 *
 * The important difference from the upstream Codex adapter:
 *   - Data lives under ~/.trae (not ~/.codex), configurable via TRAE_HOME.
 *   - There is no global history.jsonl. Submit verification uses the threads
 *     SQLite table as the authoritative session/path index, then requires an
 *     exact role=user record in that rollout's post-submit byte delta.
 *   - Skills are installed into ~/.trae/skills.
